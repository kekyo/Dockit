## What is this?

Dockit is an automatic Markdown documentation generator, fetch from .NET XML comment/metadata.

The advantage of Dockit is that it generates the document once in Markdown format
and then uses Pandoc to generate the document from Markdown.
This allows you to target a variety of output formats.

It is also much simpler to manage than other solutions,
as you simply install NuGet and it automatically generates the documentation for you.
